              "Why do we tell stories? To try to make sense of a world that can be terrifying and enormous. I don't know that your story will long be known. I don't know who will remain to tell it. But it did happen and it did matter. And though Calamity is here, because of you, it will not be here forever."

              "May I say before you go, I think that you are perhaps one of the most powerful mages that I've ever had the pleasure to be in the presence of. And for this, I would offer a gift. I think it has been a long time since anyone has pointed out to you that you are a fool. Pain doesn't make people; it's love that makes people. The pain is inconsequential; it's love that saves them. And you would know that, but you have none around you. You said so yourself, you surround yourself with lies and deceptions.
              And I wish for you in the future to find someone who will mourn you when you are gone. Respectfully."
