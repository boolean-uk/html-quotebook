          <p>To every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late, and how can man die better, than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his Fathers, and the temples of his Gods.

        <blockquote>
          <p>The majority of people don't listen to what you have to say. Not because they’re not interested, but because they're too terrified that it might change them, and if ignorance is bliss, then comfort is safety.
