            <p>Music has given me over forty years of extraordinary experiences. I can’t say that life’s pains or more tragic episodes have been diminished because of it, but it's allowed me so many moments of companionship when I’ve been lonely, and a sublime means of communication when I wanted to touch people. It’s been both my doorway of perception and the house that I live in.</p>

            <p>I’ve often wondered if, actually, being an artist in any way, in any nature, is a kind of a sign of a certain dysfunction – a social dysfunction. It’s an extraordinary thing to want to do, to express yourself in such rarefied terms. I think it’s a loony kind of thing to want to do.</p>

              <p>A marriage […] is a kind of civilisation, a kind of microcosm – it develops its own language, its own semiotics, its own slang, its own shorthand. […] To destroy, wantonly, such a relationship, is like destroying a whole civilisation.</p>

            <p>Like my hero Virginia Woolf, I do lack confidence. I always find that the novel I'm finishing, even if it's turned out fairly well, is not the novel I had in my mind. I think a lot of writers must negotiate this, and if they don't admit it, they're not being honest. You have started the book with this bubble over your head that contains a cathedral full of fire – that contains a novel so <em>vast</em> and <em>great</em> and <em>penetrating</em> and <strong>bright</strong> and <strong>dark</strong> that it will put all other novels ever written to shame. And then, as you get towards the end, you begin to realise, no, it's just this book. And it has its strengths, it has its virtues, but there's nothing about the Crimean war, there's nothing about interstellar travel. It says what it says and that's it. And it joins all the other books in the world.</p>

            Children begin by loving their parents;<br>
            after a time they judge them;<br>
            rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.

            <p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad<br>
            They may not mean to, but they do<br>
            They fill you full of faults they had<br>
            And they add some extra, just for you</p>

            <p>But they were fucked up in their turn<br>
            By fools in old-style hats and coats<br>
            Who half the time were soppy-stern<br>
            And the other half at one another’s throat</p>

            <p>Man hands misery onto man<br>
            It deepens like a coastal shelf<br>
            So get out as soon as you can<br>
            And don't have any kids yourself</p>
