        <section>“You can't give her that!' she screamed. 'It's not safe!' <br>
          IT'S A SWORD, said the Hogfather. THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE SAFE. <br>
          'She's a child!' shouted Crumley. <br>
          IT'S EDUCATIONAL. <br>
          'What if she cuts herself?'<br>
          THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT LESSON.” <br>

        <section>“Look, sir, I know Angua. She's not the useless type. She doesn't stand there and scream helplessly.

        <section>“Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.” <br>

        </section>

        <section>“It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.”
          <br>
          <span>- Terry Pratchett</span>
        </section>

        <section>“What a place! What a situation! What kind of man would put a known criminal in charge of a major
          branch of government?
          Apart from, say, the average voter.”
          <br>
          <span>- Going Postal</span>
        </section>

        <section>“Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some
          cave somewhere,
          with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even have time
          to dry.” <br>

        </section>

        <section>“The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and
          trying to put things in
          it.” <br>
          <span>- Diggers</span>
        </section>

        <section>“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.
          Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. <br> A really good pair of
          leather boots
          cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then
          leaked like hell
          when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. <br> Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought,
          and
          wore until
          the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the
          cobbles. <br>
          But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. <br> A man who could afford fifty dollars had
          a
          pair of boots
          that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, <br> while the poor man who could only afford cheap
          boots would have
          spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. <br>
          This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”<br>

        </section>

        <section>“His philosophy was a mixture of three famous schools—the Cynics, the Stoics and the Epicureans—and
          summed up all three
          of them in his famous phrase, ‘You can’t trust any bugger further than you can throw him, and there’s
          nothing you can do
          about it, so let’s have a drink.”

        <section>“If you trust in yourself. . .and believe in your dreams. . .and follow your star. . . you'll still get
          beaten by people
          who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy.”

        </section>

        <section>“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new
          eyes and extra
          colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as
          never
          leaving.” <br>
