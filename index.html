          <p>Clear your mind and get a hold on yourself and, as when awakened from sleep and 
            realizing it was only a bad dream  upsetting you, wake up and see that what's there is just like those dreams.</p>

          <p>If you wish to improve, be confident to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters--don't wish
            to seem knowleadgeable. And if some regard you a important, distrust yourself.</p>

          <p>Don't let your reflection on the whole sweep of life crush you. Don't fill your mind with all the bad things that might still 
            happen. Stay focused on the present situation and ask yourself why it's so unbearable and can't be survived.</p>

          <p>Good people will do what they find honorable to do, even if it requires hard work; they'll do it even if it causes them injury; 
            they'll do it even if it will bring danger. Again, they won't do what they find base, even if it brings wealth, pleasure, or 
            power. Nothing will deter them from what is honorable, and nothing will lure them into what is base..</p>

          <p>Consider who you are. Above all, a human being, carrying no greater power than your own reasoned choice,
